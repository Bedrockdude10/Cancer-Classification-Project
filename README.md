Code written for the final project for MATH 4570: Matrix Methods in Machine Learning &amp; Data Analysis.

Early detection and diagnosis is critical in the treatment of cancer.
Recently, microarray gene expression data has been used to this end.
There is a wealth of genomic data available for use in diagnosis, the 
challenge now faced by researchers and medical practitioners is extracting 
meaningful information from all this data.

We propose an application of machine learning to address the multi-class classification
problem presented by the microarray data. In particular, we will use deep neural networks
to analyze the curated microarray datasets provided by the Structural Bio-informatics and 
Computational Biology Lab in the hopes of outperforming the benchmarks on these datasets,
and building a more general model which can accurately diagnose a variety of cancers.

After training our model, we will assess it's performance on a dataset including both
healthy and cancerous cells. We will compute the precision and recall of our model(s)
and discuss the implications of the different types of errors in a medical setting.
